This research project evaluates the performance of Paragraph vectors (Doc2Vec) against feature vectors that are derived from traditional NLP feature extraction algorithms like Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

Two different classifiers are used to compare both feature extractors: logistic regression and k-nearest neighbor. This is done to eliminate any potential bias on how the classifiers work since one classifier is a parametric classifier while the other is a non-parametric classifier.
