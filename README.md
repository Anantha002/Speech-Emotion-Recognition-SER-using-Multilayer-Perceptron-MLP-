# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-SER-using-Multilayer-Perceptron-MLP-

This capstone research project uses Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) which helps companies to automatically detect customer satisfaction through their emotions without the need for customer feedback. This is achieved by implementing a neural network technique called Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) which is based on a supervised learning algorithm.
